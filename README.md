# SpaceInvadersGame
A simple Space Invaders recreation I made. More importantly, it is the first game I created using programming. It uses keyboard controls to move the player's spaceship, then a Bullet class controls the shooting mechanism. Checks for a win and a loss, while incorporating uploaded images for graphics.
